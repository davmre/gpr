This is very much a work in progress.

See test.py for unit tests and usage examples.

Features:
	- GP training, prediction, sampling, and likelihood evaluation
	- Saving and loading trained models to/from a file
	- Common kernels included, easily extendable to arbitrary kernels
	- Maximum-likelihood hyperparameter optimization
	- Common kernel hyperparam prior distributions including gamma, inverse gamma, lognormal, and of course these are extensible. 
	- k-fold cross-validation with multiple loss functions.
